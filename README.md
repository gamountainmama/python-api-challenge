# python-api-challenge

In WeatherPy, I analyzed weather for cities near randomly generated geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).  
I created and graphed scatterplots and linear regressions of maximum temperatures, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed vs. latitude.  
I compared the data for the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere and evaluated the validity of each linear regression.  
  
In VacationPy, I created a map of each point from WeatherPy with the point size showing the humidity.  
I then narrowed down the dataframe to include my personal weather preferences by temperature and humidity.  
With the narrowed data, I used the Geoapify API to search for hotels near each latitude and longitude within a radius of 10,000 meters.  
Finally, I created a map of each ideal location including the the point size showing humidity, and the ability to hover over the point and identify data about the location, specifically adding the hotel name (if there was one within 10,000 meters) and country.
